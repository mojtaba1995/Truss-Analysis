TRUSS.TXT is input file and TRUSS_RES.TXT is output.


# Truss Analysis

This code is for analyzing truss using stiffness matrix. This code was developed based on a course project for structural analysis course.

## Getting Started

Run in Truss-Analysis/src/__init__.py with python while you keep the input file (TRUSS.TXT) in the same path as your code. The TRUSS_RES.txt will be generated after you run the code.


### Detail

It is possible to understand both input and output files by looking in the RESULT.TXT file. 
For instance, these lines are related to defining different materials with different properties and the elements of a truss.

```
MATERIAL PROPERTIES
1   200000.0   0.00129
2   200000.0   0.00258
ELEMENT   NODES   MAT.
1   1   6   2
2   2   6   2
3   2   7   2
